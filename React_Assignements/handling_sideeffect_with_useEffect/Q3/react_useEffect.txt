Component Lifecycle in React And Cleanup Function

In React functional components, the component lifecycle is managed using the useEffect hook. It allows developers to perform actions at different stages of a component’s life.

1. Mount Phase:

The mount phase occurs when a component is rendered for the first time and added to the DOM.
useEffect with an empty dependency array runs once during this phase. It is commonly used for initial data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or initializing resources.

2. Update Phase:

The update phase happens whenever a component re-renders due to changes in state or props.
useEffect with dependencies runs whenever the specified dependencies change. It is used to react to updates such as recalculating values, updating UI behavior, or syncing data.

3. Unmount Phase:

The unmount phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM.
This phase is handled using a cleanup function inside useEffect, which runs just before the component is destroyed.

Cleanup Function in React

A cleanup function is a function returned inside useEffect. It is executed when a component unmounts or before the effect re-runs.

Why Cleanup Is Needed:

To prevent memory leaks

To stop timers and intervals

To remove event listeners

To cancel subscriptions or ongoing tasks

Without cleanup functions, unused resources may continue running in the background, leading to performance issues and unexpected behavior.
