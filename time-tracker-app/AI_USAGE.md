## What AI Couldn't Do

- Make design decisions (required human judgment)
- Test the actual application
- Set up Firebase project
- Record video walkthrough
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Lessons Learned

1. **AI is a tool, not a replacement** - Still need to understand the code
2. **Prompt engineering matters** - Better prompts = better results
3. **Verification is crucial** - Always test AI-generated code
4. **Combine multiple tools** - Different AI tools for different tasks
5. **Human creativity essential** - AI assists, humans decide
